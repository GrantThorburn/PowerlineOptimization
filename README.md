# PowerlineOptimization
Given simple environmental constraints,optimization of laying wire between power stations for lowest costing solution that is viable.

The prompt for the constraints is listed below:

A power station is on one side of a river that is one-half mile wide, and a factory is eight miles downstream on the other side of the river (See figure below). It costs $7 per foot to run power lines over land and $9 per foot to run them under water. The objective is to determine the most economical path to lay the power line, determining how long the power line should run under water and how long it should run over land to achieve the minimum total cost of laying the power line.

The user enters the following:
a.	The width of the river
b.	The distance of the factory downstream on the other side of the river
c.	The cost of laying the power line under water
d.	The cost of laying the power line over land. 

The program then outputs the length of the power line that should run under water and the length that should run over land so the cost of constructing the power line is at the minimum. The program also outputs the total cost of constructing the power line.
